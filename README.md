# seq-submission-metadata-R

1. Please clone this repo and then open seq_submission_metadata_scripts.html in the browser of your choice.  That html is the real readme.

2. A text file outlining all commands and steps run is in covid_seq_submission_pipeline_code.txt.
	
	Note: As of Sept 6, 2021 this file only overs steps through SRA submission.  I am still working through the rest of the steps with pipeline / code adjustments
